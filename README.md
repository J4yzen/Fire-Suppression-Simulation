Fire Suppression Simulation Engine

By Jason Izuchukwu



This project simulates a dynamic environment where fires spread through a forest grid, and firefighters respond by extinguishing fires and refilling water from water sources. The simulation demonstrates object-oriented programming principles with multiple interacting classes.



Key Features



-Dynamic Fire Spread: Fires spread probabilistically based on cell type



-Pathfinding: Firefighters navigate toward nearest fires or water sources



-Resource Management: Firefighters track water capacity and refill when low



-Collision Detection: Actors cannot occupy the same cell



-Visual Console Output: Real-time grid display with different symbols for each entity





Prerequisites: C++17 Compatible Compiler



Key Learning Outcomes



This project demonstrates:



-Polymorphism: Different actor types with shared interface



-Encapsulation: Clean separation between world management and entity behaviour



-Resource Management: Proper handling of dynamically allocated objects



-Algorithm Design: Pathfinding and neighbour search implementations



-Debugging: Comprehensive logging and state tracking
